Key Changes:
Modularization: Functions like CheckHotFixes, CheckPermissions, and DisplayBasicUserInfo have been broken into separate subroutines to reduce duplication.
Progress Tracking: Reused the ProgressUpdate subroutine to consistently update the title with progress percentage.
Simplified Code Flow: Avoid repetition by moving registry queries and common tasks into reusable subroutines.
